# 10-Essential-Encodings 

Encodings are algorithms that transform amino acid sequences of varying lengths into numerical vectors of uniform length, which is a critical requirement for many machine learning (ML) algorithms.  

Encoding biomedical data is crucial for transforming complex, often non-numeric information into numerical formats suitable for computational analysis, including machine learning.


10 encryption methods introduced:

# 1. Sparse encoding
# 2. Amino acid composition
# 3. Pseudo amino acid composition
# 4. Reduced amino acid alphabet
# 5. Physicochemical properties
# 6. Moran_autocorrelation
# 7. Broto_moreau autocorrelation 
# 8. Fourier Transformation
# 9. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)
# 10. General structural encodings
