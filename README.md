# 10-Essential-Encodings 

Encodings are algorithms that transform amino acid sequences of varying lengths into numerical vectors of uniform length, which is a critical requirement for many machine learning (ML) algorithms.  

Encoding biomedical data is crucial for transforming complex, often non-numeric information into numerical formats suitable for computational analysis, including machine learning.


10 encryption methods introduced:

# 1. Sparse encoding
